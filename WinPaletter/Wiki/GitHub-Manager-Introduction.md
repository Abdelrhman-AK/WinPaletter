The **GitHub Manager** is a built-in feature in WinPaletter that allows you to manage **your own themes** directly from your GitHub account.

It replaces the older, complex theme publishing workflow and makes managing and publishing themes significantly easier.

---

## What It Does

GitHub Manager is designed for:

- Managing **your personal theme repository**
- Uploading and updating your themes
- Organizing your theme files
- Publishing themes for public access

It does **not** browse or manage other users' themes automatically.  
It focuses on giving you full control over your own theme collection.

## Security & Transparency

> [!note]
> - GitHub Manager only interacts with repositories under your GitHub account.  
> - It does not access unrelated repositories or private data without your permission.
> - If you have any concerns about this, consider using a separate, empty GitHub account specifically for managing your themes.
> - WinPaletter is open-source, so developers can review the GitHub integration implementation and verify how authentication and repository operations are handled.

## Replaces the Old Store Developer Method

> [!important]
> The previous multi-step publishing process described in the old Store Developers guide is now **deprecated**.

Previously, publishing themes required:

- Manual repository setup
- Specific folder structures
- Manual themes uploading
- Complex submission steps

GitHub Manager eliminates these manual steps.

Everything can now be handled inside WinPaletter with a simple interface.

---

## Explorer-Like Interface

GitHub Manager looks and behaves similarly to **Windows Explorer**, making it intuitive and easy to use.

You can:

- Navigate folders
- Create new folders
- Upload themes
- Rename files
- Delete files
- Update existing themes

No command-line usage.
No external Git client required.
No advanced Git knowledge required.

---

## Requirements

To use GitHub Manager, you only need:

- A GitHub account
- Internet connection
- Using WinPaletter application itself (not GitHub within the browser)

That’s it.

---

## Publishing Themes for Everyone

GitHub Manager introduces a simple way to publish your themes publicly.

You can:

1. Upload your theme to your repository.
2. Send a publication request (means a pull request to Abdelrhman-AK) and wait until approval.

This allows other users to download your themes directly within WinPaletter Store for themes.

---

## Benefits Over the Old Method

- Simpler workflow
- No complex repository managing
- Everything managed inside WinPaletter

---

## Summary

GitHub Manager modernizes theme management in WinPaletter.

It focuses on managing **your own themes**, while also making it easy to publish them for public access.

The old Store Developer workflow is now obsolete and no longer required.
