### 1. Colors

- There are 16 colors sorted in tables from `0` to `15`

- Colors from `8` to `15` should be lighter than their relative colors from `0` to `7`

- You can choose colors from the lower track bars, choosing a number means choosing its associated color from colors tables

- You can change background and foreground of both console and console pop-up

### 2. Fonts

![alt text](Assets/CMD/cmd_5.png?raw=true)

- You can change font type, weight and size

- The only fonts you can select are monospaced (fixed pitch) fonts

- You can force using other fonts by checking this, but the console will render these fonts wrongly

- Font weights can be `Don't care`, `Thin`, `Extra Light`, `Light`, `Normal`, `Medium`, `Semi Bold`, `Bold`, `Extra Bold` and `Heavy`

- These weights are not availabe for all fonts, if the selected font supports these weights, the console will render the font in the selected weight

- Raster font toggle is a toggle to enable the classic pixelated (retro) font in console. Selecting it will ignore the selected font and weight, and font size will be replaced by a list of dimensions: `4×6`, `6×8`, `6×9`, `8×8`, `8×9`, `16×8`, `5×12`, `7×12`, `8×12`, `16×12`, `12×16` and `10×18`

### 3. Cursors

- You can change cursor size in all versions of Windows

- You can change cursor color and style in Windows 10 1909 and later (provided that enhanced terminal is checked in 'Tweaks' section)
