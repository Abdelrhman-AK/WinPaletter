### Notes:

> These notes are for WinPaletter Versions from `1.0.3.0` to `1.0.6.3` only

- First Version Supports Translation is `1.0.3.0`.

- Telegram group is deleted as it isn't necessary now. We will depend on GitHub only.

- It is better to export language while the language is native (English).

- Returning to native language is by deactivating custom language from settings, saving settings and restarting the application.

- If you want to regularly contribute in a better translation, use the updated WinPaletter (Latest Versions) every-time you translate.
