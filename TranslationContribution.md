### Notes:

- First Version Supports Translation is 1.0.3.0.

- It is better to export language while the language is native (English).

- Returning to native language is by deactivating custom language from settings, saving settings and restarting the application.

- If you want to regularly contribute in a better translation, use the updated WinPaletter (Latest Versions) every-time you translate.
