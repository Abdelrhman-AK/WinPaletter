# Language Modification Notes

## About authors

The first author is me. But I'm not the first in time. I only made this version of translation by my self, excluding most of old translation made by others.

The reason why I put myself in the front is, it can imply who made the translation version. I thought translation is a work of endless, so latest author in the front would be better for user to distinguish. I don't think the place to show in the software can show a string that is too long. This is due to the design of layout.


## About meanings 

I must admitted that, I change some common noun usage trickily. I believe it would be better if users with little knowledge of system are able to understand those things, whether it's about configs or logs or not. And here I list what I change in a table.
