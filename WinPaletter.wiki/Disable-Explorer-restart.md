- Sometimes in devices with poor performance, restarting Explorer takes a long time and it may disturb you while designing and testing themes.

- You can disable Explorer restart, but this won't apply all aspects correctly. In this case when you finish designing, logoff your Windows and then logon again.

- Open Settings `>` Theme applying behavior `>` General `>` Uncheck `Automatic restart explorer every time I apply a theme`
