## 1. Steps

1. [Read this first: How to design themes for the WinPaletter Store repository](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/wiki/Designing-themes-rules).
2. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one. If you already have an account, log in.
3. Go to the [WinPaletter Store Repository](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter-Store) (not the main WinPaletter repository).
4. Click **Fork** at the top of the page to create your own copy of the repository.
5. Go to your GitHub profile page. You will see the WinPaletter Store Repository forked to your account (this is like having your own copy).
6. In your fork, navigate to the `Themes` directory. Create a new folder with your name, then add another folder inside it with your theme name. Upload your theme file (`.wpth`) here.  
   *If your theme uses extra resources (images or sounds not part of Windows system folders), upload the theme resources pack file (`.wptp`) as well.*
7. Create a **pull request**. After your request is approved and merged, your theme will be available to everyone in the WinPaletter Store.

> [!Important] 
> The WinPaletter developer may not always be available. Your pull request will be merged as soon as possible.

> [!Warning] 
> 1. You are responsible for the copyrights of the themes and resources packs you upload. The WinPaletter developer is not responsible for any copyright violations.
> 2. Themes uploaded online (to the server or repository) must be created with WinPaletter version 1.0.7.7 or newer. Older themes won't load in the WinPaletter Store. If you need to update an old theme, open it in WinPaletter 1.0.7.7 or higher and use the convert button in the main window to update it.
> 3. To update a theme you've already uploaded, repeat the process starting from step 5. Replace the existing files with your updated versions and create a new pull request.
