- Changing metrics and fonts with some windows (applications) open may cause system crash

- So there is an option to delay applying of Metrics and Fonts (until you logoff and logon)

- Open Settings `>` Theme applying behavior `>` Metrics and Fonts `>` Check `Make applying Metrics & Fonts have effects only after logoff and logon (To fix its crashing issue)`
