## 1. Introduction

- If you don't know what is the meaning of **_"Windows classic colors"_**, these colors are for the classic 3D buttons and other Windows elements that have a retro style, they are illustrated in the following screenshots (Windows 98, XP and 7):

- There is no classic theme starting from Windows 8, but you can apply the classic theme by force (unofficial way).
- There are remnants (in Windows 8 and later) that you can modify; like `Hilight`, `Hilight text` and other elements.
- If classic theme is applied by force, you can get use of all colors.
