- On some devices with lower performance, restarting **Explorer** may take a long time and can interrupt theme design and testing.  

- You can **disable automatic Explorer restart**, but note that not all theme changes will be applied immediately. In this case, finish designing your theme and then **log off and log back on** to apply all changes.  

### To disable automatic Explorer restart:  
 1. Open **Settings** → **Theme Applying Behavior** → **General**  
 2. Uncheck **"Automatic restart Explorer every time I apply a theme"**
