- Make it enabled if you like to use custom shadow in current selected cursor

- If you enabled it, please disable shadow in miscellaneous part (to disable shadow that Windows renders and use shadow rendered by WinPaletter)

![alt text](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/WinPaletter.Wiki/Asset/Cursors/cursors_7_1.png?raw=true)

- You can change color of shadow with its blur power and opacity, with the ability to move it in `X` and `Y` coordinates

- This is an example for a red shadow applied to app starting cursor
