### 1.0.1.0

> **Details:**

| Branch   | Released on |
|:--------:|:-----------:|
| `Stable` | 10 Jun 2022 |

> **Changelog:**

- Now you can use WinPaletter on Windows 11 22621, but with precautions:
  1. Disable Automatic Restarting Explorer From WinPaletter Settings
  2. If you want to see instant effects of applied palette, restart explorer yourself
  3. If you faced crashing: Open Command Prompt as Administrator and type:  
     `sfc /scannow`  
     `dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`  
     Then close Command Prompt and restart you Windows
  - You might face this in Windows 10, if so, run app as Administrator only or do the same previous steps.
  - The problem was that killing explorer of Win11-22621 automatically crashes it and crashes also Windows Apps (WinUI3\UWP)
  - I'll rewrite a better code for restarting explorer
