### 1.0.9.0

> **Info:**

| Channel  | Release Date |
|:--------:|:------------:|
| `Stable` | 01 Apr 2024  |

## 🛑 Announcement: Project Development Discontinuation:

Dear WinPaletter Users,

It is with a heavy heart that I announce the discontinuation of further development on the WinPaletter project. While there's an extremely slim possibility that I may find time in the distant future, perhaps years from now, to resume maintenance, I must inform you that version `1.0.9.0` marks the end of active development. Subsequent versions (`1.0.9.x`) has extremely weak possibility to be developed.

In the coming days or weeks, I will proceed to archive this repository. However, please note that the existing version will remain accessible for continued use, albeit without updates or maintenance.

You can certainly contribute to the WinPaletter Store for themes; this repository won't be archived. [Open the Wiki](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/wiki) and navigate to the WinPaletter Store section in the side panel.

I want to express my deepest gratitude for your support and for choosing WinPaletter. Your enthusiasm and feedback have been invaluable throughout this journey. It has been an immense honor for me to contribute to a project that aimed to enhance your user experience. If WinPaletter has caused any inconvenience or disruption to your Windows setup, I sincerely apologize.

# New features:

### 1. WinPaletter new look

- In this release, WinPaletter boasts a revamped appearance with a massive UI refresh, including the introduction of a new tabbed navigation system for an organized and intuitive user experience. The addition of tabs enhances visual appeal and facilitates seamless task-switching. Embrace the improved visuals and navigation as I strive for a more user-friendly interface in every aspect of the application.

### 2. Windows Visual Styles
- In this release, WinPaletter introduces a new feature that allows you to change Windows Visual Styles (part of #225).
- This feature requires patching UxTheme.dll. There will be a guide available within its form to patch it, either by using SecureUxTheme from its [official releases in its repository (recommended)](https://github.com/namazso/SecureUxTheme/releases) or by utilizing the SecureUxTheme setup wrapper provided by WinPaletter.

### 3. Windows Icons

- This new feature will allow you to modify desktop icons, certain explorer icons, control panel icons on the main page, and shell32.dll.
- It won't patch system files; this process involves modifying the registry exclusively.

### 4. Changes in all Windows aspects

- Some aspects (Windows Colors, Classic Colors, Cursors, Metrics, Fonts, and Wallpaper) will have two modes: Advanced Mode and Simple Mode. This change aims to make modifying Windows easier for users who found WinPaletter complex to use #190.

- All aspects will feature a toggle controller (including aspects that didn't have it before, such as Windows Colors and Classic Colors), allowing users to control all Windows aspects and disable aspects they do not wish to modify.

- All aspects will now include a toolbar featuring a simplified button layout (instead of the old and condensed buttons). Additionally, a split button is introduced to provide more functions, such as importing schemes from Windows defaults or current preferences.

### 5. Changes in Windows aspect; Windows Colors

- Fixes in previewer and performance improvements.

- Per-element modifier; click on an elements on the preview to change its color.

- Windows 11/10 Accent Colors Generator: Modify the titlebar color, then click 'Generate Accent Colors from Active Titlebar Color' to make WinPaletter generate nine accent colors based on this selected color.

- Palette Generator: Improved performance and bug fixes, featuring a trials panel that records previous attempts to generate a palette, making it easier for users to revisit and select a preferred trial.

### 6. Changes in Windows aspect; Classic Colors

- Per-element modifier; right click on an elements on the preview to change its color.

- 3D and flat degrees modification in 3D objects improved.

- Magnifier: Use it to view small details in the preview, such as shadow borders and dark shadow lines. This feature makes it easier to utilize the per-element modifier.

- Schemes Gallery: Preview all Classic Colors schemes in a single form, aiding users in visualizing and selecting their preferred scheme.

- Fullscreen Preview: Expand the preview to fullscreen for a better examination.

- Resolved exception error when importing from visual styles designed for Windows versions newer than XP.

### 7. Changes in Windows aspect; Metrics and Fonts

- Per-element modifier: Click on an element in the preview to alter its font and drag-and-drop to adjust its sizes.

- Resolved a visual bug related to applying fonts with high DPI settings, preventing issues such as small or large fonts and irregular icon sizes not aligned with the selected DPI (scaling) value #205.

### 8. Changes in Windows aspect; Cursors Studio

- Enhanced rendering of classic styles, introducing pixelation for a more accurate and similar appearance to classic Windows cursors.

- Fixed: the center point animation of the hourglass in classic style.

- ⚠️ Known issue: Higher DPI scaling will render classic cursors wrongly.

### 9. Changes in Windows aspect; Windows Terminals and Consoles

- The JSON read/write mechanism for the terminal has been upgraded to improve code readability for developers and enhance the structure of theme files to match terminal JSON precisely. 

- Fixed a bug in creating a new external terminal (incorrect registry key path).

- Resolved issue where opening PowerShell for testing launches 'takeown' PowerShell executable instead of the intended PowerShell.

### 10. Changes in Windows aspect; Others

- LogonUI now supports preview for Windows 10 and 11.

- Screen Saver: Lists installed screensavers on the system to assist users in selecting one.

- Sounds: Added a 'Restore Defaults' button to facilitate the restoration of a sound entry.

- Sounds: WinPaletter will no longer install System Events Sounds by default at application startup. Users can manually install it in the Sounds form or Settings. However, if already installed, it will be updated automatically with a newer service version if available #206.

- Increased speed of Wallpaer Tone previewer.

- WinPaletter Application Themer: Introducing new colors for errors (secondary color) and tips (tertiary color), along with an option for animations.

### 11. Themes backup and restore

- WinPaletter now introduces a new feature that allows you to automatically backup your themes.

- Backing up before applying themes is enabled by default in WinPaletter.

- You can also back up upon application startup or when opening a theme file (these options are not enabled by default).

- You can open theme backups from the toolbar on the home page (main form).

- You can control the backup folder location and other settings in Settings > Themes Backup.

### 12. Aspects control

- WinPaletter now introduces a new feature that allows you to increase your control over Windows aspects. This will be helpful for users who don't want to change a Windows aspect they like (acts like a secure lock).

- For example, a user edited Windows Colors to an accent they like and doesn't want it to change again with any theme. This user can enable this feature and uncheck Windows Colors to disable editing it in the future.

- Another example is a user who likes their own Metrics and Fonts; using WinPaletter's store may override their preferences. This user can enable this feature and uncheck Metrics and Fonts to disable editing them in the future.

- You can find this feature in Settings > Aspects control.

### 1.0.8.5

> **Info:**

| Channel  | Release Date |
|:--------:|:------------:|
| `Beta`   | 18 Feb 2024  |

⚠️**Warning**
If you are using command lines, type `WinPaletter -?` in any terminal to know new commands formats

⚠️**Known issue**
Due to massive changes in Windows Terminal structure in WinPaletter, an error may occur when opening a theme file as the structure has been completely revised. You can safely ignore this error and continue using the theme file; however, note that the old preferences from the older theme file for the terminal will be disregarded until you resave the theme.

# New Features:

### 1. WinPaletter new look

- In this release, WinPaletter boasts a revamped appearance with a massive UI refresh, including the introduction of a new tabbed navigation system for an organized and intuitive user experience. The addition of tabs enhances visual appeal and facilitates seamless task-switching. Embrace the improved visuals and navigation as I strive for a more user-friendly interface in every aspect of the application.
- This is not the final look. In the new beta releases, UI changes will continue to be made, improved, and any discovered bugs will be fixed.

### 2. Changes in all Windows aspects

- Some aspects (Windows Colors, Classic Colors, Cursors, Metrics, Fonts, and Wallpaper) will have two modes: Advanced Mode and Simple Mode. This change aims to make modifying Windows easier for users who found WinPaletter complex to use #190.
- All aspects will feature a toggle controller (including aspects that didn't have it before, such as Windows Colors and Classic Colors), allowing users to control all Windows aspects and disable aspects they do not wish to modify.
- All aspects will now include a toolbar featuring a simplified button layout (instead of the old and condensed buttons). Additionally, a split button is introduced to provide more functions, such as importing schemes from Windows defaults or current preferences.

### 3. Changes in Windows aspect; Windows Colors

- Fixes in previewer and performance improvements.
- Per-element modifier; click on an elements on the preview to change its color.
- Windows 11/10 Accent Colors Generator: Modify the titlebar color, then click 'Generate Accent Colors from Active Titlebar Color' to make WinPaletter generate nine accent colors based on this selected color.
- Palette Generator: Improved performance and bug fixes, featuring a trials panel that records previous attempts to generate a palette, making it easier for users to revisit and select a preferred trial.

### 4. Changes in Windows aspect; Classic Colors

- Per-element modifier; right click on an elements on the preview to change its color.
- 3D and flat degrees modification in 3D objects improved.
- Magnifier: Use it to view small details in the preview, such as shadow borders and dark shadow lines. This feature makes it easier to utilize the per-element modifier.
- Schemes Gallery: Preview all Classic Colors schemes in a single form, aiding users in visualizing and selecting their preferred scheme.
- Fullscreen Preview: Expand the preview to fullscreen for a better examination.
- Resolved exception error when importing from visual styles designed for Windows versions newer than XP.

### 5. Changes in Windows aspect; Metrics and Fonts

- Per-element modifier: Click on an element in the preview to alter its font and drag-and-drop to adjust its sizes.
- Resolved a visual bug related to applying fonts with high DPI settings, preventing issues such as small or large fonts and irregular icon sizes not aligned with the selected DPI (scaling) value #205.

### 6. Changes in Windows aspect; Cursors Studio

- Enhanced rendering of classic styles, introducing pixelation for a more accurate and similar appearance to classic Windows cursors.
- Fixed: the center point animation of the hourglass in classic style.
- ⚠️ Known issue: Higher DPI scaling will render classic cursors wrongly.

### 7. Changes in Windows aspect; Windows Terminals and Consoles

- The JSON read/write mechanism for the terminal has been upgraded to improve code readability for developers and enhance the structure of theme files to match terminal JSON precisely. 
- ⚠️ Known issue: Due to these changes, an error may occur when opening a theme file as the structure has been completely revised. You can safely ignore this error and continue using the theme file; however, note that the old preferences from the older theme file for the terminal will be disregarded until you resave the theme.
- Fixed a bug in creating a new external terminal (incorrect registry key path).
- Resolved issue where opening PowerShell for testing launches 'takeown' PowerShell executable instead of the intended PowerShell.

### 8. Changes in Windows aspect; Others

- LogonUI now supports preview for Windows 10 and 11.
- Screen Saver: Lists installed screensavers on the system to assist users in selecting one.
- Sounds: Added a 'Restore Defaults' button to facilitate the restoration of a sound entry.
- Sounds: WinPaletter will no longer install System Events Sounds by default at application startup. Users can manually install it in the Sounds form or Settings. However, if already installed, it will be updated automatically with a newer service version if available #206.
- Increased speed of Wallpaer Tone previewer.
- WinPaletter Application Themer: Introducing new colors for errors (secondary color) and tips (tertiary color), along with an option for animations.

### 9. Themes backup and restore

- WinPaletter now introduces a new feature that allows you to automatically backup your themes.
- Backing up before applying themes is enabled by default in WinPaletter.
- You can also back up upon application startup or when opening a theme file (these options are not enabled by default).
- You can open theme backups from the toolbar on the home page (main form).
- You can control the backup folder location and other settings in Settings > Themes Backup.

### 10. Aspects control

- WinPaletter now introduces a new feature that allows you to increase your control over Windows aspects. This will be helpful for users who don't want to change a Windows aspect they like (acts like a secure lock).
- For example, a user edited Windows Colors to an accent they like and doesn't want it to change again with any theme. This user can enable this feature and uncheck Windows Colors to disable editing it in the future.
- Another example is a user who likes their own Metrics and Fonts; using WinPaletter's store may override their preferences. This user can enable this feature and uncheck Metrics and Fonts to disable editing them in the future.
- You can find this feature in Settings > Aspects control.

### 11. WinPaletter Store for themes

- Faster opening of the WinPaletter Store.
- Memory cleanup for store items upon closing the Store has been fixed.

---

# Application improvements:

1. Command lines changes; type 'WinPaletter.exe -?' in any terminal for help.
2. Replaced 'Save theme file and apply theme on exit' dialog with a straightforward Windows dialog.
3. Resolved an exception error that occurred when applying a theme in a separate thread, ensuring the program does not exit before the thread completes its task.
4. The mechanism for downloading data from the web has been improved, transitioning from WebClient to HTTPClient.
5. Addressed increased memory usage during cursor rendering and after closing Wallpaper and LogonUI forms.
6. Remove all registry residuals during uninstallation #196 #191.
7. Enable the 'Colors history' feature within the 'Custom colors' section if the Windows Classic Colors picker is enabled in settings.
8. Making Metrics and Fonts applies values to open windows in a separate thread as a trial to reduce hanging #209.

> Please run `SFC /scanfile=%windir%\System32\imageres.dll` in Command Prompt as administrator and restart your Windows if you used a previous beta version to fix imageres.dll corruption made by modifying Windows startup sound. Don't use previous beta versions `1.0.7.x`.

# These are all new features since last stable release `1.0.8.0`:
# If you have read this before, read feature NO. 3 (Cursors new features), improvements and bugs fixes (to save your time)

### 1. WinPaletter is written now in C# instead of Visual Basic .NET
- In 1.0.8.3, there is extensive optimization in code after coding language shift and bugs fixes.

- Due to unknown reason, when you apply certain theme items to another user, you may notice that current user profile that opened WinPaletter is affected by the theme until logoff and log back on. After doing so, you will find that the selected user's profile is correctly themed, while the user who opened WinPaletter retains their previous state and is unaffected by the theme.
- So, the best practice method is to open target user then open WinPaletter inside this profile, not from a different one.

### 3. Cursors new features

### 1.0.7.0

> **Info:**

| Channel  | Release Date |
|:--------:|:------------:|
| `Stable` | 13 Feb 2023  |

> **What's New?**

# New Features:

### 1. Windows Metrics & Fonts:

- Suggested by @Anixx #17 
- Now you can change Windows Metrics and fonts (e.g., Titlebar Height, Titlebar Font, Window Border Width, Icons Spacing & Fonts, .... etc.)
- There are some limitations when you apply (not all items) that require logoff and logon
- `Known Issue (You may not face it)`: In Windows 11 22H2, Titlebar Font may not be changed from Segoe UI even if the font is changed correctly in registry and even if you restart your Windows.
- Fixed issue occurs during reading Metrics from Registry (Fixed bug from 1.0.6.9) #66

### 2. Fonts Substitutes (A part of Windows Metrics & Fonts):

- You can substitute some system fonts "MS Shell Dlg" and "Segoe UI" to give your Windows a different look. 
- Please read its instructions in Metrics & Fonts > Fonts Substitutes

### 3. Wallpaper Tone:

- For sure you saw some stock Windows wallpapers with different colors, you can now create your own wallpapers with the color you want.
- This is dependent on modification of image's HSL (Hue\Saturation\Lightness) and this isn't professional as much as advanced images editors (Paint.NET\GIMP\Photoshop\...)

### 4. New defined color in Windows 10/11:

- There were some undefined colors, now new 2 items are defined\known: 
  1) Background of UWP Dialogs Remnants from Windows 8.1 in Windows 10/11
  2) Taskbar Tray Overflow Background (Windows 11 22H2 with accent enabled in taskbar)

### 5. Languages:

- Languages become stable (not experimental), and its mechanism has been changed, becoming dependent on JSON files not the old file (*.wplng)
- This makes it easier to modify by a text\code editor like VSCode or by WinPaletter Language Developing Tools (In Settings > Language)
- You can load language quickly (there is no delay) and without restarting WinPaletter (Except for returning to English)
- You can use WinPaletter Language Developing Tools to create, modify or update language json files (The Tools were separated before in WinPaletter Language Translator.exe, now you won’t use it you will use WinPaletter itself).
- So, it is necessary for language creators\contributors to use the latest version of WinPaletter and update their translations\languages (As it is not complete compared to earlier versions)
- Crashes that occurred during startup while loading language files are mostly fixed. (Like: #56)
- `Known Issue`: People who are using old language files (*.wplng) and updated WinPaletter, an error will occur during loading the application, ignore this error, download newer language files (*.json), go to settings and load the new file and save.

### 6. Logs:

Extended Details will be shown during applying the theme (including time info and errors), you can change the preferences in Settings > Theme Logging.

### 7. Preview Switch

 In main page, you can navigate between all supported versions of Windows, making it easier to design one theme file for all supported Windows editions. 

### 8. Theme File Blocks:

Now the theme file that is saved by WinPaletter (.wpth) has 2 blocks for Windows 11/10 (before it was one block applied to both Windows 11/10), making it easier to design a theme presented in one file for both versions of Windows (To avoid conflict between colors applied between these Windows Versions) (Themes File of WinPaletter earlier than 1.0.6.9 can be loaded/saved too)

---

# Redesigns:

- Application’s UI improved a lot, especially the light mode becomes better, with the ability to change WinPaletter’s Colors and Backgrounds (Theming WinPaletter itself). Also, legacy dialogs like message boxes are modernized.
- Application's Controls become more consistent with System Dark\Light Mode
- Themes Previews in all forms are redesigned to match Windows Metrics and fonts (becoming more realistic compared to previous versions of WinPaletter)
- Drag and Drop preview are redesigned to have a bigger size
- Windows Terminal forms are redesigned to have tabs instead of the condensed ones.
- Name of "Win32UI" changed into "Classic Colors"
- New 3 colors schemes in Classic Colors (Win32UI): Luna Fullback Blue, Silver and Olive Green

---

# Multiple Improvements and Bugs Fixes:

1. Added the ability to uninstall from Control Panel, with fixing issue during uninstall #68
2. Loading Preferences of Windows Colors/Options from registry mechanism improved a lot, and WinPaletter will continue applying theme even if there is an error (exception error) happened (i.e., the error part will be skipped) (Issue of #59 won't be experienced and it won't disturb the whole process of applying theme, the error will be known separately after applying theme)
3. When you switch Dark\Light Mode in theme, there was a great time delay during theme applying. It is now fixed and not causing any delay in theme applying (Become quicker than before)
4. Cursors: Main Arrow is improved to match the exact outline of default Windows
5. Quick apply (found in Win32UI, Terminals, ...) mechanism changed to a better one (becoming quicker than before)
6. Confirmation Dialog that appear on closing WinPaletter will remember the preferences you choose, with the ability to control if this dialog appears or not (You can change the preferences also in Settings)
7. Newton.JSON component updated to 13.0.2 (Used in phrasing JSON files)
8. Right-Click Menu on color now will have more colors varieties & the extended menu will have Windows Terminals Colors (Previously they were not included)
9. Application Startup Speed Optimized
10. Windows 7: when choosing a color with basic mode applied, there was a crash. Now it is fixed. 
11. Windows 7: not switching basic/aero theme correctly. (Now you should logoff and logon to apply this effect correctly)
12. Improvements in Updates, especially the situation of Windows 7 that can’t connect to GitHub Repository (Fixed)
13. Fixed Windows Terminal (Stable\Preview) error after modification by WinPaletter
14. Mechanism of network detection changed, the old one was slower.
15. Fixed error in Classic Colors that caused not setting flat menus.
16. Add panels into LogonUI Forms that has buttons to open WinPaletter themes (File\Current Applied\Default Windows) (They were not added before)
17. If this option is enabled in settings <If Cursors Applying is disabled or skipped, automatic switch the cursors scheme to Windows Default "Aero"> and applied a theme without applying any custom cursors before, an error happens. It is now fixed (Actual cause of #68)
18. Fixed empty preview in Windows 7 classic (@Anixx #62 #65)
19. Fixed bug in icon preview in Metrics & Fonts (@Anixx #64)

### 1.0.1.0

> **Info:**

| Channel  | Release Date |
|:--------:|:------------:|
| `Stable` | 10 Jun 2022  |

> **What's New?**

- Now you can use WinPaletter on Windows 11 22621, but with precautions:
  1. Disable Automatic Restarting Explorer From WinPaletter Settings
  2. If you want to see instant effects of applied palette, restart explorer yourself
  3. If you faced crashing: Open Command Prompt as Administrator and type:  
     `sfc /scannow`  
     `dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`  
     Then close Command Prompt and restart you Windows
  - You might face this in Windows 10, if so, run app as Administrator only or do the same previous steps.
  - The problem was that killing explorer of Win11-22621 automatically crashes it and crashes also Windows Apps (WinUI3\UWP)
  - I'll rewrite a better code for restarting explorer
