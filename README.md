- [You will find the uploaded languages here](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/tree/master/Languages)
- [Visit this page to know how to contribute in translation](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/TranslationContribution.md)

# ![alt text](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/Media/Mini-Icons/Requirements.png?raw=true) Requirements:

- **Windows 7 and Windows 8.1:** Use WinPaletter version starting from **1.0.5.0** and higher, and you should install at least .NET Framework 4.7, or better 4.8, then reboot your Windows (Necessary) [Download it from here, choose "Runtime"](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48)

- **Windows 10 and Windows 11:** .Net Framework 4.8 is already pre-installed, so no extra step is required.

# ![alt text](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/Media/Mini-Icons/Terminal.png?raw=true) You can now modify all terminals in Windows.

- Including Command Prompt, PowerShell (Windows 7, 8.1, 10, 11) and Windows Terminal (Windows 10,11)
- You can modify background and foreground colors and popup colors, with fonts and other tweaks.
- You should read the documentation before you start editing terminals: [Read it](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/Documentations/Terminal.md)

# ![alt text](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/Media/Mini-Icons/Classic.png?raw=true) You can colorize the classic apps accents (Like what we did in the 90s and 2000s :))

- You will see perfect results if you force classic theme for Windows 11\10\8.1 (i.e All Windows elements will be colorized).
- Windows 7 has a classic theme, so it is can be modified without using external tools to enable classic theme 

![alt text](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/Media/3.png?raw=true)

- If you don't use a classic theme (Windows 11\10\8.1), this will be applicable for some Windows Elements like Dialogs backcolor, labels forecolor and hilights only (i.e. not all Windows elements will be colored like buttons, progressbar and tabpages as they are handled/managed by Visual Styles, not Windows Registry Colors).

# ![alt text](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/Media/Mini-Icons/Cursor.png?raw=true) You can customize your cursors, even the animated circles (Loading Cursors)!

- This feature debut is in version 1.0.4.0

# ![alt text](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/Media/Mini-Icons/Mechanism.png?raw=true) Idea of the program

- The Accent colors are stored in the Windows registry, one of them is stored as an array, and the others are stored singly in keys' values, and this is complex for a normal user. This program eases changing Windows elements' colors freely (i.e. You won't select one color as in Settings) and also save this to a theme file to apply it later or for sharing it.

- Some screenshots for changing colors features:

# ![alt text](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/Media/Mini-Icons/Antivirus.png?raw=true) Antiviruses or some browsers download issue

- If you face in Avast that the program is infected with IDP.Generic, then go to Avast > Updates > Update Definitions and then reopen the app after restoring it from quarantine. Avast will re-scan it and it will find that the application is clean. (It was a false positive fixed in last definition updates - Thanks to Ondrej; Avast Customer Care Team)
- Other Antiviruses (Kaspersky, Malwarebytes) found it clean, don't worry.
- Some browsers like Edge will prompt you that the program may harm the computer (The program is not signed so the browser think that the program is from unknown organization and may be harmful). You can download it anyway, don't worry.
