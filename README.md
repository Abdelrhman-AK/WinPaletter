Colorize Windows 10/11 Accents without restrictions.

# Idea of the program
The Accents are stored in registry, one of them stored as an array, and the others are stored singly in keys' values, and this is complex for a normal user. This program eases changing Windows elements colors freely (i.e. You won't select one color as in Settings) and also saving this to a theme file to apply it laterly or for sharing it.
