# Avast Problem (Just restore and add as an exception - I may try to solve this later)
Avast Behaviour shield may detect the program as IDP.Generic (False Positive).
This shield monitors for malware-like behaviour. The program is editing too many registry entries and this looks like a malware activity from the point of view of Avast.
Other Antiviruses found the program clean (Kaspersky cloud security & Malwarebytes), so it is safe to use.

# Idea of the program
Inspired by: https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/sw15u0/dark_theme_did_you_notice_the_ugly_pale_accent/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/tkvet4/pitch_black_themereg_now_for_ctrlaltdel_as_well/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

The Accent colors are stored in the Windows registry, one of them is stored as an array, and the others are stored singly in keys' values, and this is complex for a normal user. This program eases changing Windows elements' colors freely (i.e. You won't select one color as in Settings) and also save this to a theme file to apply it later or for sharing it.
