# Idea of the program
The Accent colors are stored in the Windows registry, one of them is stored as an array, and the others are stored singly in keys' values, and this is complex for a normal user. This program eases changing Windows elements' colors freely (i.e. You won't select one color as in Settings) and also save this to a theme file to apply it later or for sharing it.
