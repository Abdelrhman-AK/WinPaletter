# Antiviruses or browsers download issue

- If you face in Avast/AVG that the program is infected with IDP.Generic, then go to Avast/AVG > Updates > Update Definitions and then reopen the app after restoring it from quarantine. Avast/AVG will re-scan it and it will find that the application is clean. (It was a false positive fixed in last definition updates)

- Other Antiviruses (Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, SmadAV) found it clean.

- Some browsers like Edge And Firefox will prompt you that the program may harm the computer `(The program is not signed so the browser thinks that the program is from unknown organization and may be harmful)`. You can download it anyway.
