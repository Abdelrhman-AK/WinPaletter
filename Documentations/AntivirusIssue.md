# Antiviruses or browsers download issue

- If you face in Avast that the program is infected with IDP.Generic, then go to Avast > Updates > Update Definitions and then reopen the app after restoring it from quarantine. Avast will re-scan it and it will find that the application is clean. (It was a false positive fixed in last definition updates - Thanks to Ondrej; Avast Customer Care Team)

- Other Antiviruses (Kaspersky, Malwarebytes) found it clean, don't worry.

- Some browsers like Edge will prompt you that the program may harm the computer `(The program is not signed so the browser think that the program is from unknown organization and may be harmful)`. You can download it anyway, don't worry.
