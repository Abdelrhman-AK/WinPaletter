# Get Languages and applying them

[Visit this folder in WinPaletter GitHub Repository and download the language you want](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/tree/master/Languages)

> The New Format is `JSON`, this is the right file
> 
> Don't navigate through folder `For Versions Below 1.0.6.9` as it is for older versions, with file extension `*.wplng`

Download Language > Open app > Settings > Languages > Activate Custom Language > Open the downloaded file > Save Settings

> After saving settings, you will find language is applied without restarting WinPaletter.
> 
> Restarting is required only when you return to English

---

# Return To English

Open app > Settings > Languages > Deactivate Custom Language and erase the textbox of language file path > Save Settings and finally restart the application

--- 

# Create Language File

1) Open WinPaletter > Settings > Language > Language Developing Tools > Create\Modify Language Files (Go)

2) You can do one of these two options:
   
   - Press on `Generate New (English) only` and save JSON file as you want anywhere, then you can modify the JSON file by a Code\Text Editor (VSCode, Notepad ++, ...)
   
   **or**
   
   - Press on `Generate New (English) and open it` and save JSON file as you want anywhere. You will find the JSON file is deserialized into a tree node inside the application.

# Modify contents using a code\text editor

> Ignore\Skip this if you can't\won't  use a code\text editor
> 
> We will use VSCode for example

   ![alt text](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/Media/Lang/3.png?raw=true)

- Modify the strings in the right part colored in orange

- Never modify name of a variable in the left part colored in blue as this will lead to errors

- In `Information`'s part, `righttoleft` can be `"righttoleft": false` or `"righttoleft": true` (Not TRUE or True, keep it the same as explained before)

- Don't remove or modify brackets (`{0}`), slashes (`\` or `/`) or quotation marks (`"`), keep them consistent with your new translation.

- Load your language file as explained above in [*Get Languages and applying them*](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/edit/master/Documentations/LangContribution1.0.6.9.md#get-languages-and-applying-them) to test it.

- [Upload Your Language File to GitHub (Will be explained below)](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/edit/master/Documentations/LangContribution1.0.6.9.md#upload-your-language-file-to-github-so-others-can-use-it)

# Modify contents using WinPaletter itself

> Ignore this if you prefer a a code\text editor

1. Open WinPaletter > Settings > Language > Language Developing Tools > Create\Modify Language Files (Go) > Press on `Generate New (English) and open it` and save JSON file as you want anywhere, or press on `Open From`. You will find the JSON file is deserialized into a tree node inside the application.

2. JSON file is composed of three main regions: Information, Global Strings & Forms Strings:
   
   - **Information consists** of the translator name, language and other important data used for identification of your file.
   
   - **Global Strings**: contains text inside the code (For example: the strings used in messages boxes, ...)
   
   - **Forms Strings**: contains text of the controls inside the form.

3. How to modify contents?
   
   - Navigate through nodes until you reach the end, like this screenshot:
   
   - You will find two textboxes: (Old Value) & (New Value), modify the contents of New Value's textbox and press on `Submit Change` 
   
   - Navigate to the following nodes, and so on ...
   
   - When you finish, press on `Save As ...` and close the form
   
   - Load your language file as explained above in [*Get Languages and applying them*](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/edit/master/Documentations/LangContribution1.0.6.9.md#get-languages-and-applying-them) to test it.

4. [Upload Your Language File to GitHub (Will be explained below)](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/edit/master/Documentations/LangContribution1.0.6.9.md#upload-your-language-file-to-github-so-others-can-use-it)

5. Important notes:
   
   - In `Information\righttoleft`'s Section, only use True or False
   
   - Language Snippets used to add values like name, code or layout of a language (load these snippets when you are in `Information\lang`, `Information\langcode` & `Information\righttoleft`)
   
   - Numbers in Curly brackets should be left unchanged.
   
   - > For example: `There is {0} files` is translated into Arabic like that: `يوجد {0} ملف`
