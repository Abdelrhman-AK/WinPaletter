# How to upload themes to WinPaletter Store repository

1. [Read first how to design themes to be uploaded to WinPaletter Store repository](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/Documentations/Store/DesigningThemesRules.md)
2. Create a GitHub Account if you don't have an account, or login if you already have one.
3. Visit [WinPaletter Store Repository](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter-Store), not the main WinPaletter repository
4. Fork (You will find this button in the upper part of the page).
5. Now visit your personal account main page, you will find WinPaletter Store Repository Forked (as if cloned to your account if you don't know the meaning of Fork).
6. Navigate to folder `Themes` and create a directory that have your name, then a new directory inside it with theme name and upload your theme (.wpth) *<u>(plus your theme resources pack (.wptp) if you included resources; images and sounds not included natively inside system directories)</u>*
7. Create a pull request, once this request is approved and merged***, your theme will be visible publicly to everyone through WinPaletter Store
   
   > *** WinPaletter developer is not available all time, once he has free time, he will merge themes pull request

#### Notes:

1. You are responsible for the copyrights of the themes\resources pack you upload. WinPaletter developer is not responsible for copyrights violation by other users.

2. Themes that are included online in a server\repository must be made by WinPaletter 1.0.7.7 and higher, otherwise the themes won't be loaded. If you insist on uploading a theme made by an old version of WinPaletter, use WinPaletter 1.0.7.7 or higher to convert this theme into the new format version (You can find convert button in main form in the upper part that has buttons)

3. If you want to update your uploaded theme, do the same steps starting from step #5 and override the themes you uploaded and create a pull request
