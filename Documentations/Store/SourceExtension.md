# You can extend the scope of WinPaletter sources or even [create your own themes hosting server](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter/blob/master/Documentations/Store/OnlineStoreSource.md).

## Source extension is done by links you get online from a friend, obtained it online, or even built it.
